The “ STUDENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ” will consist of two tables, namely “Results” and “Contact Information”.
Table “Results” will store the data of Students’ Results and the Table “Contact Information” will store data of Students’ Contacts. 
The system is broadly divided  into  3 categories:  
	•	Adding or Deleting a student’s result or contact information  
	•	Searching  for  student’s result or contact information  
	•	Modification  of  in student’s result or contact information  
Our  aim  is  to  make  a  computer  program  which  makes it easier to handle data of hundreds of student if not thousands and be able to modify it later or even completely remove it if needed.
